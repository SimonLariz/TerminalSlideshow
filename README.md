# Terminal Ascii Slideshow
An awesome python program that will display ascii representations of images in the terminal.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Simply download the .py file and ensure the Pillow package is installed (See below for more details). Next once the project is setup navigate to the main() function and locate the path. Replace path with the desired path to the folder containing the images. Lastly, check the sleep delay to the desired delay between images.
